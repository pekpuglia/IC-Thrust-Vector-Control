This work presents the development and characterization process of a cold gas thruster vectorization system. The motor is required to have a thrust of \(2\; \mathrm{N}\) and a chamber pressure of \(5\; \mathrm{bar}\). The chosen vectorization method for testing was the jet vane. The constructed motor had slight deviations from the requirements, with a specific impulse of \(46.6\; \mathrm{s}\). This motor was mounted on a control mechanism of the deflecting blade, and this assembly was coupled to a three-component scale for force and moment characterization. As a final result, the control derivatives for lateral force and moment were obtained. Finally, the methodological issues encountered and engineering trade-offs identified for the system were presented.
